# STEP 1  Getting data
-downloading zip file if it hasn't already been downloaded
-unziping zip file containing data if data directory doesn't already exist


# STEP 2  Reading data
-reading training data
-reading test data
-reading features, don't convert text labels to factors
-reading activity labels


# Step 3  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
-concatenate individual data tables
-remove individual data tables to save memory
-assigning column names


# Step 4  Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
-determine columns of data set
-keeping data in these columns only


# Step 5  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- replace activity values with named factor levels

# Step 6  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
- get column names
- remove special characters
- expand abbreviations and clean up names
- correct typo
- use new labels as column names


# Step 7 Create a second, independent tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
-group by subject and activity and summarise using mean
-output to file "tidy_data.txt"

The structure of this data set, variables and transformations are presented in [Data](#data) section, [Variables](#variables) section, and [Transformations](#transformations) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `tidy_data.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables. 

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>
Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>
- `subject`
	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.
- `activity`
	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>
The measurements are classified in two domains:
- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `timeDomain`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.
- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `frequencyDomain`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

#### Time-domain signals
- Average time-domain body acceleration in the X, Y and Z directions.
- Standard deviation of the time-domain body acceleration in the X, Y and Z directions.

- Average time-domain body angular velocity in the X, Y and Z directions.
- Standard deviation of the time-domain body angular velocity in the X, Y and Z directions.

- Average time-domain body angular velocity jerk (derivation of the angular velocity in time) in the X, Y and Z directions.

- Standard deviation of the time-domain body angular velocity jerk (derivation of the angular velocity in time) in the X, Y and Z directions.

- Average and standard deviation of the time-domain magnitude of body acceleration.

- Average and standard deviation of the time-domain magnitude of gravity acceleration.

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

The following transformations were applied to the source data:

1. The training and test sets were merged.
2. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement, and the others were discarded.
3. The activity identifiers were replaced with descriptive activity names (see [Identifiers](#identifiers) section).
4. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names  `Magnitude`, `Frequency`, `Mean`, and `StandardDeviation` respectively.
5.Th final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the `run_analysis.R` R script. Please see `README.md` file.
